# Inventory-Management-System-with-Automatic-Email-Notification

In todayâ€™s busy world managing the goods stored in an Industry or any Retail store is a challenging task. To manage these goods, it is necessary to be aware of the goods that are low in quantity before the Industry or Retail store runs out of stock and in addition, over inventory must also be eliminated. It is difficult to monitor the availability of thousands of products manually. 
In order to address this problem, I have done a Inventory Management system to accomplish this challenging process. 
This system manages the stocks by monitoring their availability and notifies the products that are low in quantity to the user in advance and eliminates over inventory. 
On the other hand, it is difficult to maintain the bill history of stocks in and out, to overcome this difficulty, the purchase and sales details are maintained digitally by this system. 
And the system automatically calculates the tax for the products. This enhances data integrity. The key idea behind the proposed system is to notify low stock to the user through e-mail, so that the industry or retail store never runs out of stock. 
In addition, the user can export the sales and purchase details to an excel file when needed for statistical or other purposes. Storing data for decades in the application is a heavy burden. 
Thus, in this system, the user can empty the database, since the data is exported to excel. This system is developed in such a way that even a naive user can also operate the system easily.
